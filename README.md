# Polling Web Page

Built for the Dizplai Technical Test, this is a basic webapp with polling functionality.

## Requirements
1. Node.js Installed.
2. Express framework for Node.js:
	- npm install express.
2. Body-Parser middleware:
	- npm install body-parser.
3. EJS templating engine:
	- npm install ejs.

### How to run
Once the requirements are installed, navigate to the main directory and run: node app.js.
The WebApp will run locally on port 3000.

#### Assumptions made
Poll information is assumed to be formatted as shown in the example, which can be seen in pollOptions.json.

##### Unfinished
I planned to add functionality to save the votes within the JSON file containing the poll information, 
however I did not have time to implement this.
